Sorna API Library
=================

Sorna is an online code execution service that runs arbitrary user codes
safely in resource-constrained environments, using Docker and our own sandbox
wrapper.
It currently supports Python 2/3, R, PHP and NodeJS, with more being added.
Sorna's primary target is to provide a zero-configuration evaluation tool for
short-running programs used in education and scientific researches, such as
problem solving and plotting.

FAQ
---

The idea of a code (or function) execution service is not new.
Here we describe key differences to existing products and software with similar purposes.

* What is the difference to AWS Lambda?

  * *On-the-fly execution of code snippets:* AWS Lambda mandates its users to package their own programs with libraries as a series of zip files and explicitly deploy them to run.  Meanwhile, Sorna provides a variety of pre-configured sandbox containers and its users pass the code snippets on-the-fly at runtime as individual API requests.
  * *Result evaluation API:* Sorna offers additional APIs to evaluate the code execution results with a given set of answers for educators.
  * *On-premise deployability:* AWS Lambda is a strictly cloud-only service which requires Internet connections always, while Sorna can be deployed on your on-premise machines and portable PCs such as Intel NUC devices for use in off-line lecture rooms.

* What is the difference to Jupyter/IPython Notebook?

  * *Horizontal scalability:* Jupyter Notebook is designed for a single-user PC. JupyterHub supports multi-user scenarios but for only modest-sized, semi-trusted user groups. Sorna is designed for multiple arbitrary users and multiple servers to scale out from the very beginning.
  * *Additional security:* Sorna adds a sandbox layer using Docker containers and a custom system call filter to safely execute malicious, unpredictable user inputs without breaking the system and other users.
